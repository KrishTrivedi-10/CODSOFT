#Task 4 Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game using Python. The game allows users to play multiple rounds against the computer, with the scores being tracked throughout. The user-friendly interface provides clear instructions and feedback after each round.

Features

User Input: Prompt the user to choose between rock, paper, or scissors.
Computer Selection: The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors.
Game Logic: Determine the winner based on the rules:
Rock beats scissors
Scissors beat paper
Paper beats rock
Display Result: Show the user's choice and the computer's choice, and display the result of the round.
Score Tracking: Keep track of the user's and computer's scores across multiple rounds.
Play Again Option: Ask the user if they want to play another round.

Enter your choice of rock, paper, or scissors when prompted.
