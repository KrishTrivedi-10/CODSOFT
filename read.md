#Task 1 To-Do List

This project is designed to help users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. The application is developed using Python and utilizes the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It also incorporates SQLite for persistent task storage. The application allows users to create, update, and track their to-do lists seamlessly.

Features

Add Task: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
Delete Task: Users can remove selected tasks from their list.
Delete All Tasks: Users can clear the entire to-do list.
Usage

Add a Task: Enter the task title in the entry field and click "Add".
Delete a Task: Select the task from the list and click "Remove".
Delete All Tasks: Click "Delete All" to clear the entire list.
Exit: Click "Exit / Close" to exit the application. Tasks will be saved automatically.
This code was developed as part of my internship at CODSOFT.
